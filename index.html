  <div class="post-content">
    <p>
    Last night I dreamt I was breaking into a hospital.  While sneaking around
    evading doctors and staff i found myself climbing the outside of a marble
    staircase.  While attempting to leap from one portion to the other i became
     stuck and was sliding towards what would be a terrible fall.  Before I met
      this adrenaline pumping demise however, a doctor noticed me and helped me
       over to the other side of the staircase railing.  He looked dissapointed
       and just said to me "you're Elliott aren't ya?" to which I replied
       "why?".</p>
       <p>The doctor spoke in an agitated yet soft tone.  He asked me to
       follow him to a room, which i did.  It was there he told me I was
     dying, the method, my heartrate was slowing and would eventually stop.
     Leaving the room, the doc informed me that there was to be a service
   downstairs.  Who wouldn't want to go to their own funeral, or whatever
pre-funeral type event this would be.</p>
<p>Upon arival I was in a room filled with people who knew me.  Some were
  upset, didnt speak to me, walked past like I wasn't there.  The others,
well they wanted to do shots, were glad they caught me before my passing,
gave hugs and talked about good times.  The longer I stayed the less
people were around, this wasnt some metaphor for people being close
or more important in my life, in fact it seemed as though those most important
dissapeared from the event soonest.  Eventually there was no one left I
wanted to be around, and so I left. </p>

  <div class="post-content">
<p>After working on this blog for a little bit and tidying up my house,
I went to meet up with some friends.  We ran around jumping in dumpsters and
snagging a bunch of cool junk.  The treasures we found furnished the barren
backyard and made a pretty sick firepit.</p>
<p>We also gathered multiple christmas trees.  With these flora, their life
 slowly flowing out of them akin in style with the stubborn sap from its trunk,
we made a mighty fire by the river.  The trees made a cold night
 warm, and in return we gave them the gloriously swift death they so longed
 for.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>well oops.  i kinda forgot about this project for the past month.
      i also have wound up in less favorable circumstances than when i last
     wrote.</p>
     <p>however, i am making moves and changes to put myself right back on top.</p>
     <p>to briefly recap: I got really drunk all the time.
       Stopped being drunk all the time.
       <strong>Crashed</strong> my motorcycle then went into work covered in blood.
       They thought I was drunk even though I was just concussed.
    Got fired.</p>
